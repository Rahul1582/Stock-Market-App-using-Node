# Stock-Market-App-using-Node

This is a Stock Market app developed using Node.js, Express and Javascript.

## Usage

The use of this app is to keep track on the stock market i.e keeping track on different companies such as facebook, google etc.
This provides the information such as current price, previous close, change percent, market cap, YTD change, Week 52 High, Week 52 Low and many more of different companies.


### Getting Started

The Handlebars library is another template engine. It inherits from Mustache and, for the most part, is compatible with Mustache’s syntax. However, Handlebars adds more features (i.e., a superset).
Unlike Jade, by design, Handlebars was made so that developers can’t write a lot of JavaScript logic inside the templates. This helps to keep templates lean and related strictly to the representation of the data (no business logic).
<br>
Another drastic difference between Jade and Handlebars is that the latter requires full HTML code (<,>, and soon), and for this reason it could care less about whitespace and indentation.<br>
A Handlebars expression is {{ some content }}<br>
Here we are using IEX Cloud API Key.
